\section{Preface}\label{sec:introduction}
As part of a university blockchain project, we developed a decentralized application (DApp) that offers an engaging experience through mini-games like Tetris, Minesweeper, and Snake. Players compete to earn Donuts (DNT) tokens, based on the ERC-20 standard, which can be traded for Ethereum (ETH) or acquired by answering quizzes on topics such as Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and Ethereum. Additionally, users can monitor their progress and standings through a dedicated "scores" section within the DApp. The integration of gaming with blockchain technology provides users with a dynamic platform where they can have fun while learning and trading digital assets.
