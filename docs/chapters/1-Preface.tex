\section{Preface}\label{sec:introduction}
As part of a university blockchain project, we developed a decentralized application (DApp) that offers an engaging experience through mini-games like Tetris, 
Minesweeper, and Snake. Players compete to earn Donuts (DNT) tokens, which can be used to purchase unique NFTs, traded for Ethereum (ETH), or acquired by answering 
quizzes on topics such as Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and Ethereum. The integration of gaming with blockchain technology provides users with a dynamic platform where 
they can have fun while gaining and trading digital assets. Additionally, users can monitor their progress and standings through a dedicated "scores" section within 
the DApp.

This report outlines the development and functionality of our decentralized application (DApp) designed for a university blockchain project. It details the system architecture, from front-end design to back-end implementation, and the integration of smart contracts and token systems. The report also covers the deployment process, testing methodologies, and documentation provided, concluding with an evaluation of the project's success and suggestions for future improvements.
