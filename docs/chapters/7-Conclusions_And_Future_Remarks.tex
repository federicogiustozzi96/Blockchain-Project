\section{Conclusions and Future Remarks}\label{sec:conclusions}
This dApp has successfully implemented key functionalities such as Ethereum blockchain interactions, MetaMask wallet integration, and a token-based reward system. However, further improvements are needed in areas like smart contract flexibility, error handling, security, and scalability. Expanding wallet support, optimizing gas usage, and enhancing testing for edge cases will help ensure robustness and efficiency.\\

Additionally, the implementation of the NFT trading feature is still pending. Once completed, users will be able to buy and sell exclusive NFTs, fostering a decentralized marketplace within the platform and expanding the dApp's appeal. \\

In conclusion, while the dApp showcases important features, addressing these enhancements will help it evolve into a more robust and scalable solution capable of meeting the demands of the blockchain ecosystem.
